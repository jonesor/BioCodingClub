This is the blog of the SDU Biology Department Coding Club, where we bring together biology students and staff who are passionate, or at least curious, about coding for data analysis and visualization. We not only explore and learn about the vast possibilities of R programming, but also delve into other popular languages such as Python, Matlab, and QGIS. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced coder, the club offers a collaborative and supportive environment for you to expand your skills and network with like-minded individuals.

Join us today and let's work together to solve the biological problems of tomorrow, using the power of code!
